The town of Trier, Germany was a little less than 2 hours from Metz, France, so I decided to hop on a train to Trier for a day trip on a weekend I had nothing planned. Unfortunately it was raining so I did not explore the city as much as I would have liked, but I saw quite a bit walking around the city. 

The city of Trier is often claimed to be the oldest city in Germany; it has a long history and was conquered by the Roman empire under Julius Caesar in the 1st century BC. It was later declared the capital of the Roman province Gallia Belgica. Consequently, the city today is known mainly for its well preserved Roman monuments.

In addition, Trier was also birthplace of philosopher Karl Marx.  I got the chance to visit the house he grew up in, which has been turned into a museum that is open to the public, offering great insights into his thoughts and revelations regarding socialism.

I suppose it's fitting that Marx would be featured on a note that is worth 0 Euros, although it is ironic that the notes are being sold for 3 Euros a piece." %}
