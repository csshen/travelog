Landing somewhere between a scholarly publication and an adventurers notebook, the Galileo theme presents your words & photographs in a handsome, agreeable manner. It is well behaved on both mobile & desktop and radically minimal in its footprint. Charged and ready for deployment to Github Pages.

Suitable for shortform, longform, and probably even waveform. It is purpose-built to accomodate photographic content wonderfully and lends itself well to journaling your sojourn.
