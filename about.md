Hello there! My name is Christopher Shen, and I study computer engineering at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, GA. This past fall semester, I studied abroad in Metz, France and had the opportunity to travel throughout Europe. This blog documents some of the things I did and places I visited during my four months in Europe.
