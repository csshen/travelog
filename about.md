Hello there! I'm Christopher Shen, a computer engineering student at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia. This past Fall (2018) semester, I studied abroad in Metz, France and had the opportunity to travel throughout Europe. This blog documents some of the things I did and places I visited during my four months in Europe.<p>
